          <h4>
            Components of a Robotic Arm Joints and Links: The robotic arm
            consists of multiple segments (links) connected by joints (revolute
            or prismatic), allowing various degrees of freedom (DOF). <br />
            End-Effector: The tool attached to the end of the robotic arm, which
            interacts with the environment. It can be a gripper, welder, vacuum,
            or any other tool specific to the task. <br />
            Actuators: Motors (electric, hydraulic, or pneumatic) that drive the
            joints, enabling movement. <br />
            Sensors: Provide feedback on position, force, torque, and other
            parameters to ensure precise control. <br />
            Controller: The computer system that directs the arm's movement and
            processes feedback from sensors. <button></button>
            Power Supply: Provides the necessary energy for the actuators and
            sensors.

            Articulated Robots: Mimic the human arm with multiple rotating
            joints. They offer high flexibility and are widely used in
            manufacturing. <br />
            SCARA (Selective Compliance Articulated Robot Arm): Features a rigid
            vertical axis and flexible horizontal axes, ideal for pick-and-place
            tasks. <br />
            Delta Robots: Consist of parallelograms connected to a common base,
            known for high speed and precision in light assembly tasks. <br />
            Cartesian Robots: Operate on three linear axes (X, Y, Z), providing
            a rectangular work envelope and high precision in linear movements.
            <br />
            Cylindrical Robots: Combine rotary and linear motion, suitable for
            assembly operations requiring a cylindrical work envelope. <br />
